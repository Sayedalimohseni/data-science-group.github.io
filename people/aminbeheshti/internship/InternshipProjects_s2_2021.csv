The project would require a strong programming experiments in Python. Familiarity with information retrieval, search, ranking and AI and machine learning techniques is an advantage.   ","Composition Assistant for AI Services","This project focuses on building a conversational assistant capable of performing a dialog with a user for finding and analyzing APIs and AI services. The conversational assistant should be able to analyze the natural language, find the intent, extract key parameters from the dialog, ask for more information where needed, and deliver the results back in human language back to the user. This project will build on open source libraries for building conversational assistants, and require strong programming experience in Python, and familiarity with natural language processing techniques.","Composition Engine for AI services","This project focuses on finding, and building a composition logic for APIs and AI services. The service require taking into account the services offered, the parameters required by an API, and use the principles of human in the loop to dynamically build a composed service for a given higher level goal. This project will build on open source libraries, and require a strong Python programming experience. "

But what is the next threat for our health in the future? In Aiquist, we monitor social media contents to extract any symptoms for any physical illnesses. We use  natural language processing and time series monitoring in order to predict any future  pandemics/outbreaks/epidemics.

What is in this project for you? This is a fantastic opportunity for you to work with the state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques, while learning how to conduct research in one of the most interesting problems for both academic institutions and industry based companies.","World economy monitoring (Data Science-Researching)","A global economic recession could be the biggest challenge of any businesses/governments as it can devastate businesses and damage economic growth. According to The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), ''a recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. A recession begins just after the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends as the economy reaches its trough''. 
In Aiquist, we aim to prepare governments and businesses for any upcoming economic recession. We develop AI engines to analyze millions of rows of data crawled from thousands of news websites and predict any changes in the economy status. 
But what is in this project for you? This is a fantastic opportunity for you to work with the state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques, while learning how to conduct research in one of the most interesting problems for both academic institutions and industry based companies.","Personalizing the search results (Data Science-Researching)","Users' satisfaction could be improved by sorting search results based on their preferences. Personalizing the search results for users could be done by different data science techniques, e.g., predictive models, learning to Rank systems, and recommender systems. In Aiquist, we are looking to design a decision making engine to deliver the most relevant search results based on the users' interest and intention. This engine could redefine itself based on the feedback that it receives from the users.
But what is in this project for you? Developing a decision making system (like a recommender system) could add a great value to your resume if you want to process your career in the data-science/data-analyst field. This is also a fantastic opportunity for you to work with the state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques, while learning how to conduct research in one of the most interesting problems for both academic institutions and industry based companies."
