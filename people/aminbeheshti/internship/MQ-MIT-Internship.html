	<br />
	We will invite several companies (who have been supporting our internship program) to the workshop. <br />
During the workshop, the companies will present their projects, and if you are interested in the company/project, then:
	<ul>
		<li>You need to contact the company. The company may request for your CV and Transcript, and may interview you.</li>
		<li>After the interview with the company, you should prepare the Internship Proposal (Download the Proposal Template <a href="Internship_Proposal.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>)</li>
		<li>Complete the "MQ-Internship Form" and ask the company to sign it. Email the signed PDF file as well as the proposal to the Internship Convener.</li>
		<li>After these steps, if the internship convener approves your proposal and eligibility, then you will be able to enroll in the unit.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h3>Notice:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>From this semester, there have been major changes introduced to Comp8851 (now called Major Projects). It effectively combines the Internal Project (ITEC810/COMP8871) as well as the Internship unit (COMP8851). This means that the students who plan to the Internal Project OR Internship should take the COMP8851unit. In the first week of the unit, the students can choose between the Internal Project OR Internship. To be able to choose an internship, you will need to be (1) in your last semester; (2) have 75+ WAM; and (3) have a company sponsoring your internship.</li>
		<li>Other than the master of Data Science, other Master students (Management, Networking, and Cyber)should be able to do both full-time and part-time internships this semester. In particular, if you haveCOMP8860 available as an option to enroll in, then you should be able to do the full-time internship.</li>
		<li>There will be some changes in the internship program for the students who will start their master's program from s1-2021. In particular, other than MIT in Cyber Security, other master students starting from s1-2021can mainly do a part-time internship.</li>
	</ul>
