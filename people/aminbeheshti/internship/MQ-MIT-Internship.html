	<h3>How to Enroll in the Internship Unite?</h3>
	We will invite several companies (who have been supporting our internship program) to the workshop. <br />
During the workshop, the companies will present their projects, and if you are interested in the company/project, then:
	<ol>
		<li>Students should submit the EoI form. Then, student details will be shared with the companies.</li>
		<li>You will have access to the list of Available projects on this page "Under for Students" Section. Please notice that, you can also find other companies yourself.</li>
		<li>Please contact the company supervisor (email can be found in the available projects), and share your CV and transcript with the company.</li>
		<li>Company may organize an interview with you. After the interview with the company, you should prepare the Internship Proposal (Download the Proposal Template <a href="Internship_Proposal.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>)</li>
        <li>The Company should complete the "<a href="Template_Internship_Form.docx" target="_blank">MQ Internship Form</a>" and email it to Kristy at "kristy.oliver@mq.edu.au". The company should CC the student in this email.</li>
        <li>Kristy will be in touch with the company supervisor to finalize the internship&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		<li>After these steps, if the internship convener approves your proposal and eligibility, then you will be able to enroll in the unit.</li>
		<li><b>Notice:</b> The Company and The student <b>*MUST*</b> use their official email address.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<br/>
	<h3>Notice:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>There have been major changes introduced to Comp8851 (now called Major Projects). It effectively combines the Internal Project (ITEC810/COMP8871) as well as the Internship unit (COMP8851). This means that the students who plan to the Internal Project OR Internship should take the COMP8851unit. In the first week of the unit, the students can choose between the Internal Project OR Internship. To be able to choose an internship, you will need to be (1) in your last semester; (2) have 75+ WAM; and (3) have a company sponsoring your internship.</li>
		<li>Who can do full-time Internship? In particular, if you have COMP8860 available as an option to enroll in, then you should be able to do the full-time internship.</li>
<!--		<li>There will be some changes in the internship program for the students who will start their master's program from s1-2021. In particular, other than MIT in Cyber Security, other master students starting from s1-2021can mainly do a part-time internship.</li>
	</ul>
