Domain markets to both sides of the real estate ecosystem, seekers (buyers and renters) and agents. For most Australians, buying a property is a significant life decision, and so consumers want confidence that they’re buying the right property. To help seekers make the right decision, we employ ML models to understand the customer journey and serve personalised listing recommendations. For real estate agents, they want to maximise the exposure of their listing to the potential audience. Our products help agents to market their listings as well as tools to facilitate the selling process."

These models are used to detect when an online interaction is with a live human as opposed to a presentation attack using a photo, video, or deepfake.  This is a critical feature that mitigates the risk of fraudulent actors creating fake accounts and taking over the accounts of other people.  Our AI models need to be updated on a regular basis to ensure that we can protect our clients from the latest wave of attacks that leverage new genAI tools.","Checks of ID document authenticity","Fraudsters have an incentive to create fake identity documents so they can sign up for a range of services including credit cards, crypto exchanges, and gambling sites.  These fake IDs are also used for Account Takeover (ATO) where the fraudster poses as the real account owner. These fraudsters are now leveraging genAI tools to create hyper-realistic identity documents that even expert human reviewers cannot detect as fakes.  This research stream is focused on updating our forgery detection models to ensure we can detect that latest attack vectors.  ","Building a global Identity database","Truuth has built a global Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform that enables our clients to verify the identity of their users regardless of which country they are from.  This requires us to have the capability to detect, classify, authenticate, and extract data from identity documents for a wide range of countries.  New identity documents are introduced by governments at regular intervals and we need to update our global database to ensure we have accurately captured images and metadata for each new document class.  The objective of this research stream is to extend our database to new countries and optimise the process for adding new documents so that it can be done in less than 2 hours."

With grids becoming more complex with IOT (Internet of things) devices such as smart meters wirelessly sending metering information and renewable generation sources allowing microgrids to power themselves, there is a need to have an AI intelligence to manage this system. 

The simulated microgrid will consist of a solar array, a community battery, a load consisting of a community of households that represents a region in Australia, and it will be connected to the main grid network. The main goal is to create an AI that can make optimal decisions about when to supply or take power from the grid based on electrical energy market price predictions from the AEMO (Energy Australia Market Operator) to minimise the costs of the microgrid. To make these decisions the AI will consider the future energy usage of the households (load forecasting), the energy generation forecast of the solar array and the capacity of the battery. The AI’s success will be measured by how it uses this data to know when to charge up the battery, when to use the solar array or battery to power the households and when to draw or supply power to the grid to optimize the monetary costs of the microgrid.
