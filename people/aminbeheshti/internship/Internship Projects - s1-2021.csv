The rapid advancement of computing and information processing
techniques has sped up the progress and applications of artificial intelligence (AI), which aims to enable computers to perform tasks via
simulating intelligent human behaviors, such as inferencing, analysis,
and decision making (Duan, Edwards, & Dwivedi, 2019; Topol, 2019).

Motivation:

One of the crucial objectives of AI in education is the provision of
personalized learning guidance or supports to individual students based
on their learning status, preferences, or personal characteristics (Hwang,
2014). To provide personalized learning, it is necessary to represent different exams which enable computers to understand different exams.

Problem description:
Since paper-based exams can be transferred to documents and computer-based exams produce documents for different questions, the question is transferred into how to represent documents to vectors.

Challenge:

For a question in exams, there are different answers. It is difficult to represent these answers and their relationship by BERT(Devlin J,2018).
For an exam, there are different questions, it is challenging to construct a vector for answers corresponding to these questions.

","Automatic rubric generation in education","Background
A rubric has three essential features: evaluation criteria, quality definitions and a scoring strategy (Popham 1997). Used as part of a student-centered approach to assessment, rubrics have the potential to help students understand the targets for their learning and the standards of quality for a particular assignment, as well as make dependable judgments about their own work that can inform revision and improvement (Reddy, 2010).

Motivation
Rubric is generated to score an assessment, check students’ work and reflect on feedback from others which can reduce instructors’ workload. 

Problem description
By given a series of assessment and the feedback of instructors, rubrics are generated gradually.

Challenge

It is difficult to extract answers from various assessments.
It is challenging to score each answer.
It is challenging to evaluate the accuracy of generated rubrics.

","Automatic marking on assessments in education","Background:

Assessment is a vital part of an educational process, time spent assessing students should be no longer than time instructing them (Klein2011). Administration and processing of students’ assessments imposes a large toll on the instructor’s time. It notes that 30% of British teachers’ time is
spent on marking(O. Mason 2002) .

Motivation:

To reduce time spending on marking assessments, it is necessary to propose an automatic marking scheme.

Problem description:

According to given rubric, an assessment is marked automatically.

Challenge：

It is difficult to compare assessments to rubric.
It is challenging to mark scores on assessments.
It is difficult to evaluate the accuracy on the automatic marking scheme.

The proliferation of deep-learning models poses a real threat to personal privacy as model developers/owners may use individuals’ information as part of their model training sets in an unauthorised way, i.e., without informing them. For example, model developers/owners can fetch someone’s face image from a social network, and use it to train sophisticated surveillance systems.

To protect the user's privacy, recent research has introduced solutions that “modify” the user information (through perturbations) in order to make the user data unusable by unauthorised machine learning models. 

The objective of this project is to explore the limitations of the existing privacy solutions. Sitting on the side of an unauthorised deep-learning model, the student/intern will design and test techniques for exploiting the user information even when privacy defenses are in place. The findings of this project will be used to investigate enhanced privacy defense mechanisms.  ","Analyzing Machine Unlearning Techniques","Deep learning has recently emerged as a great fit for a range of critical applications on personal users’ data, such as face recognition.

For example, model developers/owners can fetch someone’s face image from a social network, and use it to train sophisticated surveillance systems.

With the goal to make deep learning applications more transparent to users, the research community has developed solutions based on data tracing that allow the users (data owners) to interrogate a model and determine if their data are used by the deep learning model or not. For instance, users might explicitly ask the company owning the model to remove (“forget”) their data, and then use these solutions to check if the model has correctly “unlearned” their personal data.

The objective of this project is to explore the limitations of these solutions. The student undertaking the project will design and test techniques to counteract the data tracing, thus making it impossible for users to determine if a model is exploiting their data.","Transforming a Firewall Rule Automation Framework from Python to a C Sharp .Net Tool","Enterprise networks have become vital to the operation of organisations.

With the expenditure of enterprise networks, the security concerns have become more critical. Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered and exploited to stage cyber attacks. As much of the business world continues to go digital, it is imperative that forward-thinking companies focus on securing their systems from external threats. An initial step towards achieving this task is discovering the vulnerabilities in the enterprise networks. Tools to perform this task such as the Nessus and Opal do exist. However, they are not deployed in every organization that needs to be secured. Therefore, security personnel do sometimes need to infer the output of the vulnerability scanners.

This internship project is dedicated to inferring the enterprise network vulnerabilities based on the migro-segmentation firewall rules governing the network internal traffic. The first step towards achieving this goal is inferring the services running on the different machines based on the ports and protocols of the firewall rules. The main challenge of this approach is the fact that Some applications may not have their ports registered, applications may use ports other than its well-known ports (non-privileged users) in addition to dynamic allocated port numbers. 

Once the applications are identified, the second step is to identify the vulnerabilities that each of these applications are reported to have. Therefore, this opportunity requires:

    • Good Knowledge of the network addressing scheme. 
    • Good Knowledge of Python programming language. 
    • Good Knowledge of Machine learning to be able to use existing Python machine learning libraries to perform the required tasks.","Automated Micro-Segmentation Impact on Enterprise Network Security","Dr. Nardine Basta, Postdoctoral Research at Optus Macquarie Cybersecurity Hub
Traditional firewalls are designed to inspect and secure traffic coming into an environment north-south direction (i.e., in- and out-bound traffic). Microsegmentation provides greater control and visibility over the growing amount of east-west traffic (i.e., in-bound traffic among different entities) across the organisation which bypass the traditional firewalls. 

The aim of micro-segmentation is to apply Zero Trust security controls around the individual IT service workload. Managing controls at a micro level, prevents unauthorised lateral movements between servers–only explicitly permitted flows are allowed. As a result, if a breach occurs, the initial compromised device has limited access to other devices and is restricted from lateral movement exploration. There exist multiple providers for micro-segmentation tools. This research relies on the Ditno workload-based security controls to create a Zero Trust network since Ditno uses an automated approach for the segmentation rules creation. Furthermore, we have full accessibility to the tool implementation and documentation. 

This work is dedicated to assessing the impact of micro-segmentation on enhancing the enterprise network security and minimizing the exposure of the network resources. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to investigating the performance enhancement as a result of automating the firewall rules creation. 

To assess the impact of micro-segmentation on the different enterprises, network traffic records of different customers are obtained and analyzed. Two types or records are collected: Firewall rules and Nessus Vulnerability Scanner records. 

Tasks:

The internship opportunity is dedicated to assessing and quantifying the overall enterprise network security risk using probability attack graph which can be 1 automatically generated using tools such as MULVAL [1], [2], [3] and a vulnerability metric such as the CVSS [4], [5]. The main challenge to achieve this goal is handling and formatting the big data collected from the enterprise network to generate the input required for the Mulval tool as detailed below: 
    • Mining the firewall rules to form a connectivity graph representing the communicating parties in the network. 
    • Analyzing the firewall rules to detect anomalies in the communication 
    • Mining the Nessus records to infer the different assets configurations 
    • Assessing the Nessus records to detect the different network assets vulnerability. 

Another challenge lies in parsing and analyzing the generated attack graph and calculating graph-based metrics to assess the security of the enterprise network. The customer enterprise network needs to be assessed prior to and post the deployment of the micro-segmentation. The attack gaps and the vulnerability scores are to be compared and evaluated.

Project description:
This project is focused on the design and implementation of a framework which enables web applications to leverage a FIDO authentication protocol to achieve high assurance of user identity. The framework will add an additional layer of security for selected calls between frontend and backend of the application. Using FIDO as a tunnel for the rest call we want to achieve an integrity between strong just-in-time authentication and high risk calls.

Important factor of the project is that the framework should be easily integrable with existing systems. The aim is that any application, which uses http calls to the server, can use this framework with minimal integration effort. It should be easily pluggable into the JavaScript code of the main application.

Problem statement:
Majority of modern web applications work based on the client-server setup. The communication is performed using HTTP(S) requests. User session is maintained with either cookies or bearer tokens. Each request in the communication has to hold the session for being authorized to execute on the server. The lifetime of the session varies between applications, but it is common that for better user experience the session is long lived.

This creates a problem for backend servers, because the confidence about the holder of the session decreases with time (i.e the probability of session being stolen rises in time). In some cases, the action executed on the server should be performed with the increased level of trust. Examples of such actions can be password reset, modification of mobile number or money transfer. Hence, the architecture of the web application has to enable a special mechanism to support the above use case. Examples of such mechanisms are reauthentication (web application asks to present credentials one more time to renew the session), step-up authentication (web application asks to present second factor authentication to increase the trust of the session), transaction authentication (web application asks for authentication for the single transaction).

We noticed that the transaction authentication problem still exists. For example, many financial institutions are using sms codes, which were proven not to be a secure second factor (i.e sms codes are vulnerable to the phising). Looking at the landscape of strong authentication methods, we selected FIDO protocol as a mature and open source solution which gains more and more popularity. However, even though FIDO gives a convenient API, the integration of FIDO for the transaction authentication is still not trivial. 

FIDO protocol:
The framework will use FIDO protocol. It enables easy execution of the 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) with strong cryptographic proof. The protocol is based on the public key cryptography. There are three parties in the protocol execution: FIDO server, client (in this case frontend of web application) and authenticator (FIDO token). Authenticator is in possession of a human actor (user). FIDO has two phases: attestation and assertion. Attestation is used for the first interaction and it allows to establish key pairs. Assertion is used afterwards to execute authentication.

Project goal:
Design and implement a comprehensive framework which solves the transaction authentication problem with strong authentication using FIDO protocol.

Example use case:
    1. User authenticates using credentials
    2. User goes to his setting page
    3. User changes sensitive data (i.e. phone number)
    4. User clicks save button
    5. FIDO authentication is triggered
    6. User follows the protocol and provides FIDO authentication
    7. Save action is sent together with a successful FIDO assertion.
    8. Backend accepts the change
    9. User sees modified data

Project tasks:
    1. Design robust and scalable architecture for the system
    2. Design touching points of the system (with web app frontend and backend)
    3. Incorporate FIDO protocol
    4. Use FIDO parameters to achieve integrity
    5. Implement working MVP of the system
    6. Create audit log for FIDO transactions
    7. Create system documentation

Technologies/Languages involved:
    • FIDO Server (one of open source implementations in golang, java or js)
    • FIDO Server persistence storage (one of nosql databases)
    • Frontend WebAuth library (js)
    • Docker (for application containerization)

Challenges:
    1. Achieve security properties of the system (integrity, nonrepudiation, authenticity, confidentiality)
    2. Create framework flexible enough to be able to easily integrate with existing applications
    3. Create a secure relation between FIDO transaction and REST call
    4. Reuse FIDO structures

Project outcomes:
    1. System design practice
    2. Web application security knowledge
    3. Public key cryptography knowledge
    4. Deep knowledge of FIDO protocol
    5. Implementation experience of frontend and backend applications

What is the problem you will be working on?
Mobile apps often collect user’s private and sensitive information and might use or share them with third-parties with/without user’s awareness, exposing users to security and privacy risks. It is of importance to provide an understanding of how mobile apps are collecting user’s information and using/sharing this information with third parties, ways to measure quality of service and functionalities offered by these apps, as well as methods to analyse potential security and privacy issues in using these apps. Thus, we aim to design and develop a system to detect the fundamental issues and causes of security and privacy risks of mobile apps automatically and comprehensively.

What is the state-of-the-art?
We have developed a tool for collecting and analysing the privacy and security issues of mobile applications Google Play. This tool performs static, dynamic and meta-information analysis to investigate/ assess mobile apps to detect security and privacy issues including privacy policy violations, requesting sensitive permissions, third-party ads and tracking libraries usage, tracking behavior in network traffic, malware and malicious activities.
However, our current developed tool i) lacks of abilities to trigger network traffic for investigating if the app is contacting suspected tracking URL and investigating contents that the apps are sharing with third-parties, ii) relies on small Android corpus of privacy policies which limits the accuracy of our machine learning model for detecting apps with privacy policy violations, iii) was only evaluated for mHealth apps, and iv) can run on a local machine that would be difficult to use for users with incompatible system.

How would you do it and what you will be working on? 

In this internship, we aim to conduct below tasks:
- Find a solution to enable the ability to investigate the network traffic contents and investigate malicious network traffic used by apps by using VirusTotal.
- Combine existing corpuses of (confirmed) violated privacy policies and/or build a larger corpus to improve the proposed privacy policy classification model.
- We will incorporate the developed tool with enhanced features and deploy it as a publicly available web service for analysing any mobile applications automatically and comprehensively.

What is the problem you will be working on?
Online advertisers, third party trackers and analytics services are constantly tracking user activities as they access web services through their web browsers or mobile apps. While, web browser plugins disabling and blocking Ads (often associated tracking/analytics scripts), e.g. AdBlock Plus have been well studied and are relatively well understood, an emerging new category of apps in the tracking mobile ecosystem, referred as the mobile Ad-Blocking apps, received very little to no attention. With the recent significant increase of the number of mobile Ad-Blockers and the exponential growth of mobile Ad-Blocking apps' popularity, this paper aims to fill in the gap and study this new category of players in the mobile ad/tracking ecosystem.

What is the state-of-the-art?
This project aims at investigating the performance and security as well as privacy features offered by mobile Android Ad-Blocking apps (or Ad-Blockers). To this end, as a first step, we have analyzed 97 Ad-Blocking mobile apps, extracted from a corpus of more than 1.5 million Android apps on Google Play in 2017 and 2018. While the main (declared) purpose of the apps is to block advertisements and mobile tracking services, our data analysis revealed the paradoxical presence of third-party tracking libraries and permissions to access sensitive resources on users' mobile devices, as well as the existence of embedded malware code within some mobile Ad-Blockers. We also analysed user reviews and found that even though a fraction of users raised concerns about the privacy and the actual performance of the mobile Ad-Blocking apps, most of the apps still attract a relatively high rating. We are aiming to extend the analysis to the most recent updates in mobile Ad-Blocking apps on Google Play.

How would you do it and what you will be working on? 
In this internship, we aim to conduct below tasks:
- Extracting mobile apps (and their) meta-data from Google Play store for static and dynamic analysis.
- After performing static and dynamic analysis, compare and contrast the performance, security, and privacy features offered by mobile Ad-Blocking applications collected in 2017, 2018, 2020. 
- Consolidate the investigations into a technical research paper to be published in a conference or journal. 

What are the basic skills and traits we are looking forward to?
