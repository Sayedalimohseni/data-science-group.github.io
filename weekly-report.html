    <h3>Weekly Reports for <a href="https://data-science-group.github.io/people/aminbeheshti/">Dr. Amin Beheshti</a>'s Students</h3>

    

    It is a good idea that I receive weekly reports written in English from my MRes/PhD Students.
    <br /><br />
    A weekly report can be: 
    <ul>
        <li>A summary of the academic paper(s) you are reading. What is the: research problem? contribution? added value of the paper comparing to the state of the art? Pros/Cons of the proposed approach? </li>
        <li>A summary of anything that you read/watched (News report/article, novel, movie, etc.).</li>
        <li>Opinion on anything (research, current events, arts, movies, music, politics, etc.).</li>        
    </ul>

    Notes:
    <ul>
        <li>I will make comments on your repots (grammar, logic, contents, etc.). This helps you improve your writing over time, and also it helps me to measure your progress in a qualitative way.</li>
        <li>Make sure, you do not copy/paste from other sources and it is your pure writing.</li>
        <li>You should aim to summarize the report into 1 page.</li>
        <li>At the bottom of the report, list the academic papers you plan to read. That will give me a good idea where your research is heading.</li>
        <li>I have shared a folder with each of my students on OneDrive. Each week you will upload the weekly report in your folder. And will also email me a copy of the report.</li>
        <li>Name the report file as follows: YYYY-MM-DD_YourName_ReportNo.pdf</li>
        <li>Download the Template: <a href="weekly-report.doc">HERE</a></li>
    </ul>
